# Quadratisch-Praktisch-Grün
This problem comes from a competition in Germany called [JWINF](https://bwinf.de/jugendwettbewerb/). It is from the 42nd competition and was the first time I participated. Since it is a German competition, the documentation is also in German. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/Dennis-Bauer/JWINF-42_Runde-3). The original PDF is also included, this solution earned me the maximum possible points, so if you want to take a look at it, you can find it [here](./Junioraufgabe1.pdf).

The task itself was presented on a large board, which I won’t include here. I only copied the text into this documentation, but if you want to see the original version, you can visit the official [repository](https://github.com/Dennis-Bauer/JWINF-42_Runde-3).

The original program I wrote was in Java, but now I migrated it to TypeScript. Because of that, there are some rounding differences. In a few test cases, the last decimal place may therefore differ from the test cases in the documentation.
