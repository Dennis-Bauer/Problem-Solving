## What is a Sudoku
First of all we need to understand what a **Sudoku** is. 

Sudoku is a logic puzzle played on a square grid that can come in
different sizes, like **4×4**, **9×9**, or even **16×16**.

The grid is always divided into smaller equal squares, and the challenge
is to fill all the empty spaces with symbols --- usually (And in this case) numbers --- so
that each symbol appears only once in every **row**, every **column**,
and every smaller **square**.

The exact set of symbols depends on the grid size:

-   In a **4×4** puzzle you use the numbers **1 to 4**
-   In a **9×9** puzzle the numbers **1 to 9**
-   In a **16×16** puzzle the numbers **1 to 16**
-   *and so on*

No matter the size, the idea is the same: carefully place the symbols
using logic until the whole grid is complete.
