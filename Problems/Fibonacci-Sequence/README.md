# Fibonacci Sequence
Create a class which has the following functions:
- `fibonacci(n)` This function should return the calculated Fibonacci number, so that it returns the n'th number in the Sequence
- `next(n?)` This function should calculate the next Fibonacci number and than push it to the Sequence saved in an extra Array. You can call it with an number n, which repeats the progress n times 
- `value` It should contain the last value in the saved Sequence
- `sequence` It should contain the generated Sequence
