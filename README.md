# Problem-Solving
This repository is about solving coding-problems. It contains famous (or not that famous) problems with my solution. I ranked the problems as <span style="color:green">Easy</span>, <span style="color:orange">Medium</span> and <span style="color:red">Hard</span>. These ranks reflect the time I invested in the problem and how difficult it felt to me.
